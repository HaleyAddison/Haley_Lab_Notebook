# Seagrass Biomass Sampling Protocol


**Goal: Obtain dry weight of sea grass portions above and below the sediment surface**   


## Materials and Equipment  
- Core (x cm diameter)
- Mesh bags to collect sample
- Numbered labels for each sample
- Pre-weighed aluminum tares
- Razor blade


## Protocol Steps

#### Field sampling
- Collect 8 cores approx x cm deep and x cm wide at randomized angle and distances from sediment sample.
- Place cores in mesh bag with a specified label. Note which numbered sample corresponds with which angle and distance.
- Filter out any sediment in the roots of sea grasses and get sample as clean as possible using fresh or salt water.

#### Wet lab Processing
- Create or collect pre-weighed tares and not their initial weight. 
- Seperate grasses by species, and place macroalgae into a different group. 
- Within each species, use razo to cut the photosynthetic material (grass blades) from the base. Scrape any epiphyte off and place these blades into a tare labeled "Above Ground".
- Rinse and sediment from remaining rhizophores and root systems and place into a tare labeled "under ground" .
- Repeat this process for each species. PLace algae into their own tare (no above and below).
- Fold each tare so that it is closed on 3 sides and leave the open side wide enough to allow for air circulation.
- Place all tares into a drying oven at ___ degrees for ___ days. 
    - *In this study, some larger samples were left to dry for as long as 6 days*


#### Dry Lab Processing
- Re-weigh all samples and mark down their post-drying weight. 
- Subtract the weight of the tares alone to obtain the weight of the dried plant matter above and below the surface.
